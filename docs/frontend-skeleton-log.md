# Front-End Skeleton Build Log

## Timeline – November 4, 2025
1. **16:28** — Captured gameplay + UX research summary (`docs/family-feud-research.md`).
2. **16:57** — Added placeholder data utilities for question sets and sessions.
3. **17:21** — Implemented routing shell with shared layout and navigation metadata.
4. **17:49** — Scaffolded dashboard, question management, session controls, player join, and auth pages with base CSS.
5. **18:14** — Documented backend integration expectations and refreshed project README files.

## Verification Steps
- Run `npm install` at repo root to ensure workspace deps restore.
- Launch `npm run dev --prefix client` to verify routes render with placeholder data.
- Validate linting with `npm run lint --prefix client` (optional; no new lint errors expected).

## Next Actions
- Replace placeholder datasets with API clients once endpoints stabilize.
- Wire form submissions and session actions to live controllers.
- Expand CSS tokens into full design system after functionality sign-off.
