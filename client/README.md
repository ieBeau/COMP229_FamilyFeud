# Family Feud – Front-End Skeleton

## Overview
React + Vite SPA that powers the host dashboard, question management, session control, contestant join, and full-screen game board experiences for the Family Feud project. Styling is intentionally minimal; focus is on layout structure, data requirements, and integration touch points for the upcoming backend release.

## Tech Stack
- React 19 with Vite 7
- React Router 7 for nested routing
- Plain CSS modules (`styles/index.css`) for baseline layout primitives

## Available Scripts
```bash
npm install                     # from repo root to install all workspaces
npm start                       # runs client (Vite) + server (Express) concurrently
npm run dev --prefix client     # front-end only (Vite on 5173)
npm run build --prefix client   # production build
```

## Project Structure
```
client/
  src/
    components/      # Shared UI primitives (Layout, PageSection)
    pages/           # Route-aligned views (dashboard, sessions, auth, etc.)
    utils/           # Placeholder data scaffolding for question sets & sessions
    styles/          # Baseline, un-themed CSS tokens
```

## Current Status
- Host dashboard surfaces placeholder metrics via `questionSets.js` and `gameSessions.js`.
- Question set CRUD form and list are static shells with inline `TODO (Backend Team)` annotations.
- Sessions view outlines live controls and utility actions awaiting API hooks.
- Player join screen delivers access code form plus buzzer button ready for WebSocket wiring.
- Auth views now call `/api/users/` and `/auth/signin`, sanitising responses until backend removes sensitive fields.
- Basic full-screen Home landing is live on `/` (dark blue stage color, centered logo, Sign In and Play buttons). A shared slide‑out menu (`LandingNavControls`) keeps navigation consistent between Home and Game Board while the global header stays hidden on the landing screen.
- `/game-board` now renders the TV-style stage: round intros, question zoom overlay, face-off buzzing (Space bar), answer timers, strikes/steal flow, and placeholder team assets sized for the exported PPT cards. Eight slots render in 1/5, 2/6, 3/7, 4/8 order with empty cards forced to the bottom row to keep the layout balanced.
- Placeholder round/question data still lives inline inside `client/src/pages/GameBoard.jsx`. Once the backend exposes a question-set feed, replace the hard-coded array and hydrate the UI via context or React Query.
 - Placeholder routes are available:
   - `/under-construction` for unfinished flows and buttons
   - `/signed-out` confirmation after sign‑out
   - `*` → 404 Not Found page

### Dev Proxy
- Vite dev server proxies API calls to the backend:
  - `/api/*` → http://localhost:3000 (development)
  - `/auth/*` → http://localhost:3000 (development)
  - Set `credentials: 'include'` when calling auth routes so the cookie is stored.

## Next Steps
1. Replace placeholder data (dashboard + game board) with fetch hooks once REST endpoints are available.
2. Introduce global state management (React Query or Redux) as soon as live data is consumed.
3. Layer in real-time communication (Socket.IO or native WebSocket) for buzzer + host controls.
4. Apply design system styling and responsive refinements after functionality stabilizes (PPT assets establish current layout ratios).
5. Replace the temporary landing drawer with a shared, auth‑aware global nav and surface role‑based routes after sign‑in.
6. Replace placeholder routes (UnderConstruction/SignedOut) with final implementations as endpoints and flows land.

## Branch & PR Workflow
- Use feature branches per change (e.g., `feature/front-end-skeleton`).
- Push the branch and open a PR against `main`. Small follow‑up commits auto‑update the PR.
