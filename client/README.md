# Family Feud – Front-End Skeleton

## Overview
React + Vite SPA that powers the host dashboard, question management, session control, contestant join, and full-screen game board experiences for the Family Feud project. The client now wires directly to the Express API for authentication, random question pulls, and AI-powered answer validation while placeholder utilities continue to unblock dashboard/session scaffolding.

## Tech Stack
- React 19 with Vite 7
- React Router 7 for nested routing
- Plain CSS modules (`styles/index.css`) for baseline layout primitives

## Available Scripts
```bash
npm install                     # from repo root to install all workspaces
npm start                       # runs client (Vite) + server (Express) concurrently
npm run dev --prefix client     # front-end only (Vite on 5173)
npm run build --prefix client   # production build
```

## Project Structure
```
client/
  src/
    components/      # Shared UI primitives (Layout, PageSection)
    pages/           # Route-aligned views (dashboard, sessions, auth, etc.)
    gameplay/        # Game board engine, constants, and helpers
    utils/           # API client + placeholder data scaffolding for dashboard/session shells
    styles/          # Baseline, un-themed CSS tokens
```

## Current Status
- Host dashboard still surfaces placeholder metrics via `questionSets.js` and `gameSessions.js`.
- Question set CRUD form and list remain static shells with inline `TODO (Backend Team)` annotations.
- Sessions view outlines live controls and utility actions awaiting API hooks.
- Player join screen delivers access code form plus buzzer button ready for WebSocket wiring.
- Auth views call `/api/v1/auth/*` endpoints (signin/signup/signout/validate) to manage JWT cookie state via `AuthProvider`.
- Home landing + game board share a slide-out drawer; global header hides on `/` for hero focus.
- `/game-board` is now fully data-driven: it fetches random rounds via `/api/v1/question`, hydrates the eight-slot grid, submits guesses to `/api/v1/ai/:questionId`, and uses `useGameBoardEngine` for timers/buzz/strike logic. Placeholder avatars/team labels remain until lobby wiring lands.
- Placeholder routes are available:
  - `/under-construction` for unfinished flows and buttons
  - `/signed-out` confirmation after sign‑out
  - `*` → 404 Not Found page

### Dev Proxy
- Vite dev server proxies API calls to the backend:
  - `/api/*` → http://localhost:3000 (development)
  - `/auth/*` → http://localhost:3000 (development)
  - Set `credentials: 'include'` when calling auth routes so the cookie is stored.

## Next Steps
1. Replace dashboard/session placeholder utilities with live REST endpoints when available.
2. Fix auth edge cases (await password comparison, align cookie names) and add better error messaging in the client once backend patch lands.
3. Layer in real-time communication (Socket.IO or native WebSocket) for buzzer + host controls.
4. Apply design system styling and responsive refinements after functionality stabilizes (PPT assets establish current layout ratios).
5. Replace the temporary landing drawer with a shared, auth‑aware global nav and surface role-based routes after sign-in.
6. Replace placeholder routes (UnderConstruction/SignedOut) with final implementations as endpoints and flows land.

## Branch & PR Workflow
- Use feature branches per change (e.g., `feature/front-end-skeleton`).
- Push the branch and open a PR against `main`. Small follow‑up commits auto‑update the PR.
